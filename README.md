# FirstAngularCrud

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) when I was learning Angular.
It helps me to learn the building blocks of an angular applications such as services, resolvers, routers, models and components.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
